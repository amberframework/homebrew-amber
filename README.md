# Amber
This section provides an introduction into Amber command-line interface. 

Amber provides a CLI client that makes interfacing with your file system and applications much smoother. The Amber console provides a framework for creating, generating, saffolding and running your Amber project.


## Installation

You can build the `amber` tool from source:

```shellsession
$ git clone git@github.com:amberframework/amber.git
$ cd amber/
$ shards install
$ make
```

You should now be able to run `amber` in the command line.


Optionally, you can use homebrew to install.

```shellsession
